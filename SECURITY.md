Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any other public forum.

### 2. Submit a Private Security Report

Send details to: **security@yourcompany.com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30-90 days depending on complexity

- We will provide credit for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong, unique secrets for `SESSION_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`
   - Rotate secrets regularly

3. **Database Security**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Enable SSL for database connections in production
   - Regular database backups

4. **Redis Security**
   - Enable Redis AUTH
   - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections
   - Configure proper firewall rules

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes require review
   - Focus on authentication and authorization logic
   - Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Enable MFA for administrative accounts

4. **Logging**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
