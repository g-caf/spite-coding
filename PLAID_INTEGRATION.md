# Plaid Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Plaid integration system built for the Expense Platform. The integration provides seamless bank account connections, real-time transaction syncing, intelligent matching, and automated expense processing.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PlaidClient** - Low-level Plaid API client wrapper
2. **PlaidService** - High-level service orchestrating Plaid operations  
3. **TransactionProcessor** - Handles transaction normalization and deduplication
4. **SyncJobProcessor** - Background job processing for transaction syncing
5. **PlaidWebhookHandler** - Real-time webhook processing
6. **TransactionMatcher** - Intelligent receipt-transaction matching engine

### Database Schema

The integration adds several new tables to the existing schema:

- `plaid_items` - Plaid institutional connections
- `plaid_accounts` - Bank accounts from Plaid  
- `plaid_transactions_raw` - Raw transaction data from Plaid
- `plaid_webhooks` - Webhook event log
- `plaid_sync_jobs` - Background sync job queue

}
```

### Webhook Endpoint

#### `POST /webhook/plaid`
Receive real-time updates from Plaid.

This endpoint handles various webhook types:
- `TRANSACTIONS` - New or updated transactions
- `ITEM` - Connection status changes
- `ERROR` - Error notifications

## Transaction Processing Pipeline

### 1. Raw Transaction Storage
- Transactions are first stored in `plaid_transactions_raw` exactly as received
- Includes all Plaid metadata and categorization
- Enables reprocessing and auditing

### 2. Deduplication
- Uses Plaid `transaction_id` as primary key
- Handles pending vs posted transaction scenarios
- Manages transaction modifications and removals

### 3. Normalization
- Converts Plaid data to local transaction format
- Determines debit/credit based on account type
- Maps Plaid categories to local categories
- Creates or matches merchants

### 4. Local Transaction Creation
- Creates records in main `transactions` table
- Links to local `accounts` table
- Updates account balances
- Triggers matching process

## Transaction Matching Engine

The matching engine automatically connects bank transactions to uploaded receipts using multiple algorithms:

### Matching Factors

1. **Amount Matching (40% weight)**
   - Exact match: 100% confidence
   - Within 1%: 80% confidence  
   - Within 5%: 80% confidence
   - Within 10%: 50% confidence

2. **Date Matching (30% weight)**
   - Same day: 100% confidence
   - Within 1 day: 90% confidence
   - Within 3 days: 70% confidence
   - Within 7 days: 40% confidence

3. **Merchant Matching (25% weight)**
   - Uses fuzzy string matching
   - Compares receipt merchant to transaction description
   - Normalizes merchant names for better matching

4. **Location Matching (5% weight)**
   - Compares location data when available
   - Matches city, state, zip code fields

### Auto-Matching Rules

- **High Confidence (â‰¥80%)**: Automatically matched
- **Medium Confidence (40-79%)**: Creates suggestions for manual review
- **Low Confidence (<40%)**: No match suggested

### Manual Review Process

1. Users can review suggested matches in the UI
2. Approve/reject functionality available
3. Confidence scores and match factors displayed
4. Audit trail of all matching decisions

## Sync Job Processing

### Job Types

- `initial_sync` - First-time historical transaction import (up to 2 years)
- `incremental_sync` - Regular updates using cursor-based sync
- `full_refresh` - Complete re-sync from beginning
- `webhook_triggered` - Sync triggered by webhook

### Job Processing

1. Jobs are queued in `plaid_sync_jobs` table
2. Background processor runs every 30 seconds
3. Failed jobs automatically retry with exponential backoff
4. Maximum 3 retry attempts before marking as failed

### Rate Limiting

- Respects Plaid API rate limits
- Implements circuit breaker pattern for failing items
- Automatically disables items with consecutive failures

## Security Features

### Data Encryption
- Plaid access tokens encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Encryption key stored separately from database
- Sensitive data encrypted in flight and at rest

### Webhook Validation
- HMAC signature validation for incoming webhooks
- Prevents webhook spoofing attacks
- Request rate limiting on webhook endpoint

### Access Control
- Organization-level data isolation using RLS
- User-level permissions for Plaid operations
- Audit logging for all financial data access

### Compliance
- PCI DSS considerations for financial data
- SOX compliance for audit trails
- GDPR/privacy compliance for data handling

## Error Handling

### Plaid API Errors
- Automatic retry for transient errors
- User notifications for authentication issues
- Graceful degradation for service unavailability

### Sync Failures
- Detailed error logging and tracking
- Automatic disabling of problematic connections
- Health monitoring and alerting

### Data Consistency
- Transaction-based operations
- Idempotent processing
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Health Checks
- Connection status monitoring
- Sync job success/failure rates
- API response time tracking
- Webhook processing health

### Metrics
- Transaction volumes processed
- Match success rates
- Error rates by type
- Performance metrics

### Alerts
